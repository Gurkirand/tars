A rugby player was hurt very badly during a scrum and he had both of his ears ripped off... Since he was permanently disfigured, he decided to give up playing rugby for good.   His club and insurance company ensured that a large sum of money went his way.  One day, he decided to invest his money in a small but growing sportswear business.   He bought the company outright but after signing on the dotted line, realized that he knew nothing about business.   He decided to employ someone to run the shop.  The next day he set up three interviews.   The first guy was great.   He knew everything he needed to and was very enthusiastic.   At the end of the interview, the former rugby player asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?”  And the man replied, “Why, yes, I couldn’t help noticing you have no ears.”   The rugby player got angry and threw him out.  The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy.   He asked her the same question, “Do you notice anything different about me?”  She replied: “Well, you have no ears.”   He got upset again and showed her the door.  The third and last interview was with the best of the three.   He was a very young man fresh out of college.   He was smart and handsome and seemed to know all about the sportswear business.  The rugby player was anxious, but went ahead and asked him the same question: “Do you notice anything different about me?”  To his surprise the young man answered: “Yes, you wear contact lenses.”  The former rugby player was shocked, and said, “What an incredibly observant young man you are. How in the world did you know that?”  The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, “Well, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with no flipping ears!”

He jumps, shouts and waves his arms to get their attention, and, oh joy, they notice him and move in his direction.   But his happiness is short lived, as the travelers turn out to be mean and sadistic. They rough him up, and then bury him in the sand with only his head above the surface.

Suddenly, a lone traveler appears in front of him and inquires about his predicament.   **You see, first I got lost, without a compass and provisions.

Can you believe such behavior?**  **Tsk, tsk...** says the traveler, as he puts his foot on top of the man's head and pushes it under the surface **Amateurs, such amateurs...**

Valentine's day fights My wife sat down on the couch  next to me as I was flipping channels. She asked, 'What's on TV?'   I said, 'Dust.' And then the fight started....  My wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary. She said, 'I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 100 in about 3 seconds.'  I bought her a weighing scale. And then the fight started....    When I got home last night, my wife demanded that I take her someplace expensive.  So I took her to a petrol pump. And then the fight started....    My wife was standing & looking in the bedroom mirror. She was not happy with what she saw and said to me, 'I feel horrible. I look old, fat and ugly. I really need you to give me a compliment."  I replied, "Your eyesight is perfect." And then the fight started....    I asked my wife, "Where do you want to go for our anniversary?" It warmed my heart to see her face melt in sweet appreciation. "Somewhere I've not been in a long time."  So I took her to my parents' house. And then the fight started....
